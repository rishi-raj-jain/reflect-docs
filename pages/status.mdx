# Project Status

Reflect is currently in beta.

We welcome you to try it, give feedback, and begin developing your applications with it. However, we do not recommend using it for production software yet, because we cannot commit to not losing data.

The core client and server have been in use for about a year on significant projects in an on-prem configuration, and we believe them to be stable. The SaaS/deployment infrastructure is new and undergoing testing.

We expect to release a stable version in Winter 2023. Please reach out via [email](mailto:hi@reflect.net) or [Discord](https://discord.reflect.net/) if you have any questions.
