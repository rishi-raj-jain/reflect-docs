# Project Status

Reflect is in beta, and we are aiming for a stable release in Winter 2023.

The core client and server have been in use for about a year on significant projects in an on-prem configuration, and are stable. The SaaS/deployment infrastructure is new and undergoing testing.

Please reach out via [email](mailto:hi@reflect.net) or [Discord](https://discord.reflect.net/) if you have any questions.
