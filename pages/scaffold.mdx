# Scaffold a New Reflect Project

Follow these instructions to create a simple Reflect starter app based on Vite and React. It takes about 60 seconds (depending on how peppy npm is feeling today).

## Install

```bash copy
npx @rocicorp/reflect@latest create my-app
```

## Develop

Reflect has a fully local development server (`npx reflect dev`) for fast iteration.

The `watch` script inside this starter app runs both the Reflect dev server and the Vite UI server (`npx vite`) in parallel for convenience:

```bash copy
cd my-app
npm run watch
```

Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in two tabs to see it in action.

## Publish

When you are happy with your app, publish the Reflect server to [reflect.net](https://reflect.net/):

```bash copy
npx reflect publish
```

This writes a local `.env` file containing the URL of the live server, so once it's done you can run against prodution with just:

```bash copy
npx vite
```

Watch the logs from production with:

```bash copy
npx reflect tail
```

You can host the app UI just about anywhere since it's just static JS. For example, to use Vercel:

```bash copy
npx vercel
```

## Quick Code Tour

Here are the key files in this starter app.

- `src/reflect/index.ts` is the entry point for the Reflect server. This is where the mutators are registered and where authentication can be optionally implemented.
- `src/reflect/client-state.ts` defines the synced data model. This example uses the Reflect API directly, but we advise most applications to use [Rails](https://github.com/rocicorp/rails), which generates handy CRUD functions.
- `src/reflect/mutators.ts` defines the _mutators_. Mutators are how data is changed in Reflect. A mutator runs immediately (optimistically) on the client, and then later on the server as part of sync.
- `src/subscriptions.ts` defines the _subscriptions_. Reflect apps are rendered reactively. These subscriptions fire when synced data is changed either locally or by other collaborators.
