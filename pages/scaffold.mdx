# Scaffold a New Reflect Project

Multiplayer in about sixty seconds (depending on how peppy npm is feeling today).

## Install

Create a Vite/React/Reflect starter app:

```bash copy
npx @rocicorp/reflect@latest create my-app
cd my-app
npm install
```

## Develop

Reflect has a fully local development environment for fast iteration:

```bash copy
npx reflect dev
```

In a different tab, start the UI dev server:

```bash copy
VITE_WORKER_URL="ws://127.0.0.1:8080/" npm run dev
```

## Publish

Deploy the Reflect server to [reflect.net](https://reflect.net/):

```bash copy
npx reflect publish
```

Deploy the UI. You can use any hosting provider, we'll use Vercel here:

```bash copy
npx vercel
```

Watch the logs from production:

```bash copy
npx reflect tail
```

## Quick Code Tour

`reflect/index.ts` is the entry point for the Reflect server. Reflect works by running **your code** on the server.

`reflect/client-state.ts` defines the synced data model. This example uses the Reflect API directly, but we advise most applications to use [Rails](https://github.com/rocicorp/rails), which generates handy CRUD functions.

`reflect/mutators.ts` defines the _mutators_. Mutators are how data is changed in Reflect. A mutator runs immediately (optimistically) on the client, and then later on the server as part of sync. Mutators are atomic – they have access to the entire synced data model and can make arbitrary changes to it, which are guaranteed to run completely or not at all. Mutators do not need to be pure – they can do something different on client than server. For example, you can enforce permissions and validation on the server, just like a classic web application would. If the server computes a different results than a client, the client will snap into agreement with the server.

`subscriptions.ts` defines the _subscriptions_. As in other modern data systems, you render Reflect apps reactively. These subscriptions fire when synced data is changed either locally or by other collaborators.
