# Room Overflow

For some experiences it can be useful to limit the number of collaborators in a room.

Imagine a board game that has a limit of six players. If a seventh player tries to join, they should be put into a separate room. If a player leaves, the next player should take the empty spot.

The [`reflect-orchestrator`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reflect-orchestrator) package provides a reliable and efficient way to do this. It also provides a way to assign each user in a room unique attributes like cursor color or avatar.
