<Callout type="info">
The metric currently reported by `usage` is _connected client minutes_ â€“ the total amount of time all clients were connected in the period. This is different than the metric <a href="https://reflect.net/#pricing">we bill by</a> which is the number of minutes rooms were active. This will be fixed in an upcoming release.

## Granularity

Metrics are tracked at minute granularity, but updated for reports hourly.
