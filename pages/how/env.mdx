# Environment Variables

You can store environment variables in the Reflect server with the `npx reflect env` command.
These variables are then accessible at runtime in your server-side mutators and auth handler.

## Setting Environment Variables

```bash
npx reflect env set foo=bar baz=hotdog
```

By default `reflect env set` modifies the variables for the production environment that runs on reflect-server.net.

To set variables for the local "development" environment add the `--dev` flag:

```bash
npx reflect env set --dev foo=monkey baz=cantaloupe
```

## Accessing Environment Variables at Runtime

Inside a mutator, you can access environment variables with the `env` field of `WriteTransaction`:

```ts
async function myMutator(tx: WriteTransaction) {
  console.log(tx.env?.foo);
}
```

The `env` field will be defined if the mutator is running on the server, and undefined on the client.

To access environment variables in your auth handler, use the `env` parameter.

```ts
function myAuthHandler(
  auth: string,
  roomID: string,
  env: Record<string, string>,
) {
  console.log(env.foo);
}
```

## Secrets

All production environment variables are encrypted at rest and suitable for storing sensitive data like passwords and API keys.
To avoid exposing secrets on the command line, omit the `=value` when setting a variable:

```bash
npx reflect env set db_password
```

This will prompt you to enter a masked input.

Note that local development variables set by `--dev` are stored locally and not encrypted.
