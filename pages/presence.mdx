# Presence

Reflect keeps track of the clients currently connected to a room. You can use
this to show users who else is connected at any point in time, or to implement
features like cursors or selection state which should only be visible when the
associated client is connected.

Use the `subscribeToPresence` method of Reflect to watch for changes to the set of clients connected to the room:

```ts
r.subscribeToPresence((presentClientIDs) => {
  myElm.textContent = `Active Users: ${presentClientIDs.length}`;
});
```

<Callout type="info">
  When a client is offline, it will only see itself as being present.
  `presentClientIDs` will always contain the client's own client ID.
</Callout>

## Per-Client Presence State

The `subscribeToPresence` method only tells you the IDs of the clients that are present.
To do something useful with them, you will combine these IDs with additional synced data about clients.
This additional client data is custom to your application. It is read and written
like any other Reflect data and can be [modeled using the Rails helper library](./data-modeling).

For example you might model your client data like so:

```ts
import { generate } from "@rocicorp/rails";

type Client = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  cursor: { x: number; y: number };
};

export const {
  put: putClient,
  get: getClient,
  init: initClient,
  update: updateClient,
  list: listClients,
} = generate<Client>("client");
```

You can then filter this client data to just render the currently connected clients:

```ts
let presentClientIDs: ClientID[] = [];
r.subscribeToPresence((clientIDs) => {
  presentClientIDs = clientIDs;
});

let clients: Record<ClientID, Client> = {};
r.subscribe(
  async (tx) => {
    return Object.fromEntries(await listClientEntries(tx));
  },
  (result) => {
    clients = result;
  },
);

function render() {
  for (const presentClientID of presentClientIDs) {
    const presentClient = clients[presentClientID];
    if (presentClient) {
      renderCursor(presentClient);
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Currently this additional client data is part of the Reflect state
  permanently, unless you explicitly delete it. In the near future, Reflect will
  add a feature to automatically delete this additional client data when the
  client is no-longer in use.
</Callout>

## React

In React you can use the `usePresence` hook in combination with the `useSubscribe` hook.

```ts
import { usePresence, useSubscribe } from "@rocicorp/reflect/react";

const presentClientIDs = usePresence(r);
const presentClients = useSubscribe(r,
  async (tx) => {
    const result = [];
    for (const clientID of presentClientIDs) {
      const presentClient = await getClient(tx, clientID);
      if (presentClient) {
        result.push(presentClient);
      }
    }
    return result;
  },
  [],
  [presentClientIDs]
);

return (
  <div>
    {presentClients.map(presentClient => (
      <Cursor
        key={presentClient.id}
        name={presentClient.name}
        cursor={presentClient.cursor}
        ></Cursor>
    ))}
  </div>
);
```
