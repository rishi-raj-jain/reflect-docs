# Presence

Use the `subscribeToPresence` method of Reflect to watch for changes to the set of clients connected to the room.

```ts
r.subsribeToPresence((presentClientIDs) => {
  myElm.textContent = `Active Users: ${presentClientIDs.size}`;
});
```

<Callout type="info">
  When a client is disconnected, for instance due to losing internet
  connectivity, `presentClientIDs` will contain just the client's own client ID.
</Callout>

## Combining presence with data about clients

Presence information is powerful when combined with additional synced data about clients.
This additional client data is custom to your application. It is written and read
like any other Reflect data and can be modeled using the Rails helper library.

For example you might model your client data like so:

```ts
import { generate } from "@rocicorp/rails";

type Client = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  cursor: { x: number; y: number };
};

export const {
  put: putClient,
  get: getClient,
  init: initClient,
  update: updateClient,
  list: listClients,
} = generate<Client>("client");
```

You can then filter this client data to just render the currently connected clients:

```ts
let presentClientIDs: ReadonlySet<ClientID> = new Set<ClientID>();
r.subsribeToPresence((clientIDs) => {
  presentClientIDs = clientIDs;
  render();
});

let clients: Record<ClientID, Client> = {};
r.subscribe(
  async (tx) => {
    const clientEntries = (await listClients(tx)).map((c) => [c.id, c]);
    return Object.fromEntries(clientEntries);
  },
  (result) => {
    clients = result;
    render();
  },
);

function render() {
  for (const presentClientID of presentClientIDs) {
    const presentClient = clients[presentClientId];
    if (presentClient) {
      renderCursor(presentClient);
    }
  }
}
```

## React

In React you can use the `usePrescense` hook in combination with the `useSubscribe` hook.

```ts
import { usePrescence, useSubscribe } from "@rocicorp/reflect/react";

const presentClientIDs = usePresence(r);
const presentClients = useSubscribe(r,
  async (tx) => {
    const result = [];
    for (const clientID of presentClientIDs) {
      const presentClient = await getClient(tx, clientID);
      if (presentClient) {
        result.push(presentClient);
      }
    }
    return result;
  },
  [],
  [presentClientIDs]
);

return (
  <div>
    {[...presentClients].map(presentClient => (
      <Cursor
        key={presentClient.id}
        name={presentClient.name}
        cursor={presentClient.cursor}
        ></Cursor>
    ))}
  </div>
);

```
